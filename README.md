Test out this feature with this playlist: https://dbghelp.github.io/player.html?file=https://dbghelp.github.io/singapore.m3u8

Often, platforms providing livestream feeds for IPTV providers include a timeshift feature by adding additional HTTP parameters. However, this feature is typically not made available to subscribers of the IPTV service. We can access this feature by injecting the correct HTTP parameters ourselves. Usually, a timeshift of at least 6 hours is allowed, and some platforms allow more than 24 hours. Depending on the channel, even with the same IPTV provider, some channels allow a longer timeshift, while others do not allow timeshift at all.

Here are the platforms I have discovered, along with their HTTP parameter formats:

1. **Verimatrix**  
   Tested with the following IPTV providers and confirmed that it works: Singtel, Telef√≥nica, Telus

   **MPD URL pattern and example HTTP parameters:**

    <pre>https://example.com/1234<b>/vxfmt=dp/</b>manifest.mpd?xxxx=xxxx<b>&start_time=2024-12-30T15:00:00Z&end_time=2024-12-30T16:00:00Z</b></pre>

2. **Broadpeak**  
   Tested with the following IPTV providers and confirmed that it works: Starhub, Magenta TV

   **MPD URL pattern and example HTTP parameters:**

    <pre>https://example.com<b>/bpk-tv/</b>xxxx/output/manifest.mpd<b>?begin=20241230T153000Z&end=20241230T170000Z</b></pre>

3. **AWS Media Services**  
   Tested with the following IPTV providers and confirmed that it works: mewatch

   **MPD URL pattern and example HTTP parameters:**

    <pre>https://example.com<b>/out/v1/</b>8928c1140dd354c5be06db78d686eada/manifest.mpd<b>?start=1735574400&end=1735578000</b></pre>

If the mpd url of your channel is not 1, 2 or 3, then this format for guessing is applied:

`?start=1735574400&end=1735578000`





## Download previously aired TV programmes

Ensure that you can timeshift to watch the previously aired TV programme first.

Click on the download button to get the download command:
